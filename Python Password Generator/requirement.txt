install pyperclip
" For pyperclip to work on Windows, no additional modules are needed.
    On Mac, the pyobjc module is used, falling back to the pbcopy and pbpaste cl
i
        commands. (These commands should come with OS X.).
    On Linux, install xclip, xsel, or wl-clipboard (for "wayland" sessions) via 
package manager."
For example, in Debian:
        sudo apt-get install xclip
        sudo apt-get install xsel
        sudo apt-get install wl-clipboard
